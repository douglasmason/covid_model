We model universal curves of reported COVID-19 daily  infections and related deaths using a linear regression with standard errors and a weekly profile in the log space (making it an exponential regression in linear space). Using currently available data from [N. Y. Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) and [Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), we fit our model parameters to the most recent three weeks and provide projections for the next three months, assuming that the same growth rate continues during that time. In addition, we provide a time-series of growth rates for each region, as well estimates of the current week-over-week change in growth rate and its statistical significance, an indicator of where new waves or outbreaks may be occuring.

**Figure 1:** Week-over-week change in daily growth rate vs. daily growth rate among nations, filtered to nations where the likelihood to have this magnitude of change in daily growth rate or greater (the p-value) is less than 10%. Nations in the top-right are likely to be accelerating an already high growth rate, in the top-left are likely to be reversing negative growth rate, in the bottom-left are likely to be accelerating an already strongly negative growth rate, and in the bottom-right are likely to be reversing a positive growth rate.

**Figure 2a:** Three-week moving-window model prediction curves for three months and COVID-19 Daily Reported Cases and Related Deaths in the U.S. This is what we predict would happen if the trend from the last three weeks continued for the next three months. 5th-95th percentile and 25th-75th percentile regions are displayed in light and dark colors, respectively.

**Figure 2b:** Three-week moving-window model prediction curves for three months and COVID-19 Cumulative Reported Cases and Related Deaths in the U.S. This is what we predict would happen if the trend from the last three weeks continued for the next three months. 5th-95th percentile and 25th-75th percentile regions are displayed in light and dark colors, respectively

States  higher in the list are candidates for new waves or outbreaks.
